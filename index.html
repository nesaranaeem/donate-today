          <p class="donate-package-details">
            Without quality education, children face considerable barriers to
            employment and earning potential later in life. They are more likely
            to suffer adverse health outcomes and less likely to participate in
            decisions that affect them – threatening their ability to shape a
            better future for themselves and their societies.
